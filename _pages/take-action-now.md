## 1. Donate to Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP)

The humanitarian crisis requires immediate medical intervention. MAP is a UK-based charity providing essential health services and medical supplies in Gaza and the West Bank. Donations fund emergency healthcare, mobile clinics, and critical medicines for those directly affected by the conflict.

## 2. Contact Your Member of Parliament

Political pressure is a primary driver of policy change. Writing to your MP is a formal means of demanding a permanent ceasefire and the guaranteed safe passage of humanitarian aid. This action ensures your position is registered at a governmental level. You can find your MP's contact details via the official UK Parliament website: https://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-an-mp-or-lord/contact-your-mp/

## 3. Engage in Ethical Consumption
Economic leverage can be used to support corporate accountability. The Boycat app allows you to scan product barc##odes to identify and avoid companies whose activities may conflict with human rights principles. This facilitates targeted consumer choices and is a direct form of economic pressure. The app is available at: https://www.boycat.io/

## 4. Participate in Local Community Organising
Grassroots action is a fundamental component of sustained advocacy. You can volunteer with Bristol Apartheid-Free Zone (BAFZ) to participate in doorknocking campaigns, which directly engage the local community and build political awareness from the ground up. Details on how to get involved can be found on their website: https://www.bafz.org/

## 5. Attend Public Demonstrations
Public assembly is a critical expression of collective political will. The Bristol Palestine Solidarity Campaign organises regular events, including rallies and vigils. Attending these events contributes to the public mandate for political action and demonstrates a unified call for justice. You should monitor the organisation's schedule online to stay informed of their next event.
